# Community Store add-on for concrete5

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

An open, free and community developed eCommerce system for concrete5

Please refer to the project wiki for extended details - https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/wiki

The goal of this project is to provide a stable, feature rich, highly extensible and customizable 'shopping cart toolkit' for version 8+ of concrete5.
The add-on will work directly with a Bootstrap based theme, primarily Elemental, but is intended to be easily modified and overriden for a custom theme.

## Setup
The package can be downloaded, unzipped into the /packages directory (ensuring the folder name is simply 'community_store') and installed via the 'Extend concrete5' option within the dashboard.  It is recommended that a 'release' be used instead of the master branch - https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/releases

### Important note regarding versions
For new installations on V8 of concrete5 please use a 2.x release.

There is a separate 1.x branch/release of Community Store that still supports 5.7, but should only be used to maintain an existing 5.7 site.
If you are planning to install Community Store into a 5.7 site, it is _highly recommended_ to update to V8 first, _then_ install a 2.x release of Community Store.
If you are already running Community Store on concrete5.7.x it is advised _not_ to upgrade through to V8 of concrete5 and to remain on 1.x releases.

Note that an existing 1.x installation of Community Store on V8 _can_ be upgraded to a 2.x release.

Please also check that the additional add-ons you install are compatible with the version you are using. In particular, additional shipping methods will have both 1.x and 2.x versions.

With all updates, please perform appropriate backups beforehand. 

## Payment gateways
To keep the 'core' store component as lightweight as possible it does not include a payment gateway other than the 'Invoice' type.
Payment gateways are to be installed as additional add-ons.
